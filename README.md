# Planets
Simple simulation of the solar system (distances and dimensions are not to scale) using the library [three.js](https://threejs.org/). 

# Setup
A demo is available [here](https://mbenoukaiss.github.io/planets).

In order to setup the project, clone this repository and create a `vendor` folder in which you should [download three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/archive/master.zip), unzip and rename the unzipped folder `threejs`. Vendor's directory structure should look like the following :
```
vendor/
    threejs/
        build/
        docs/
        ...
        README.md
```
